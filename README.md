# usewhat

## goals

This is a start of a project intended to aosle a problem I have still after quite a long time of using the command line:

	* There are an overwhelming number of command line tools
	* Many of them do similar things slightly differently
	* It's difficult to remember which tool to use in which situation
	* 

## other ways to solve the problem that don't work for me

	* **tldr** - Once you know what to use, [tldr.sh](https://tldr.sh/) is a great tool to help quickly remember *how* to complete many common tasks. This is intended to be the step *before* `tldr`. 
	
	* **look it up on the internet** - I find myself re-researching the same things over and over again just trying to remember "what was that tool called?" which is a waste of time. At a certain point there is no more learning. 
	
	* **take notes** - the notes became hard to manage because there were so many of them; this project is intended to help focus th enote taking to the bare essentials by providing significant constraints.
	
	* **look in your history file** - once you have done something a bunch, assuming you have continuous access to the same history file and you can recall enough context, it *is* useful. If these conditions are not met it becomes difficult or impossible. Additionally it relies on having strong command of search tools to sift through it, and search tools are a category I find very confusing to remember about. 
	
	* **`apropos`** - GNU's is to my knowledge the only existing attempt to fill this need. I have not found it useful when I've tried it because it only tells you about GNU tools and because the information it spits out seems to be automatically collected from various sources without any editing. My attempts at using it have filled the screen with lots of junk. This project seeks to be more careful and concise. 

to answer the question: what application or tool should I use to do this command line task?

To test this concept, do a set of search and finding tools

	- fd
	- ag
	- fzf
	- tree
	- ls 
	- locate
	- grep (egrep, etc)
	
maybe:

	- awk
	- sed
	- up
	- percol
	- rg
	- ack
	
specialized finding tools:

	- pdfgrep
